# UPTP_Project
This is a game i made with my group for OOP final project, is an horror game called Obscured Passage where we implemented the nextbots from garry's mod, you have to scape the maze (if you can) :)
Before you play the game (i uploaded the editor mode, not the packaged version), hit the compile button (at the right of Derived Data) and then go to the Behavior tree  (all > content> FirstPerson > Blueprints > AIEssentials > AICharacter_BT) and delete the node in red (this is because the code for the behavior tree task doesn't load at the start, you have to compile in unreal engine and then go to the behavior tree and add the node again, you have to click in the bar in the low part of Sequence node and drag to the left, then select tasks and click on BTTask, click on the BTTask node (Find Player) and in the right part you will see the details part, click where it says Player key (it is self actor when you create the node) and change it to Player
Use the version 5.2.1 of unreal engine
